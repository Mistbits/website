    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      One of our longest-running collaborations is <a href="https://www.smartaonline.app" target="_blank">Smarta</a>,
      a borehole monitoring platform we built alongside a South African water company.
      From the early days, Mistbits handled everything: custom hardware, firmware, backend, web dashboard, and mobile app.
      Our two companies grew alongside each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're now building the <strong>Mistbits Whisper Network</strong>, a Meshtastic-based infrastructure for low-power IoT deployments across South Africa.
      Our own in-house devices will be running on it soon.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      We design and build connected systems — devices, embedded software, data pipelines, and dashboards.
      Most of what we make is custom-built and done in-house, from field hardware to cloud platforms.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why We Started</h2>
    <p>
      Mistbits grew out of a need to solve real problems with reliable, low-power tech.
      We care more about uptime than buzzwords, and we prefer tools that are quiet, robust, and useful.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      The Whisper Network is a foundation, not a product. We're exploring edge-connected devices, peer-to-peer tools,
      and open protocols for off-grid IoT in remote and rural places.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Work With Us</h2>
    <p>
      We're always up for honest collaborations — whether that's deploying a system, testing new gear, or building something unconventional.
