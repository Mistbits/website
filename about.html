    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      One of our longest-running collaborations is <a href="https://www.smartaonline.app" target="_blank">Smarta</a>,
      a borehole monitoring platform we co-developed with a South African water company.
      From the early days, Mistbits designed and built the custom hardware, firmware,
      backend, web dashboard, and mobile app — while both our companies grew alongside each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we're building the <strong>Mistbits Whisper Network</strong> — our own nationwide,
      Meshtastic-powered infrastructure designed for low-power IoT deployments across South Africa.
      We'll be launching a range of in-house devices to run on it soon.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      We design and build connected systems — including devices, embedded code, data pipelines,
      and dashboards. Our work spans from field hardware to cloud interfaces, built mostly from scratch,
      and mostly in-house.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why We Started</h2>
    <p>
      Mistbits grew out of a need to solve practical problems with reliable, low-power tech.
      We care more about uptime than headlines, and we prefer tools that are quiet, resilient, and purpose-built.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      The Whisper Network is a foundation — not a product. We're experimenting with
      new kinds of edge-connected devices, networked tools, and open protocols to
      support off-grid IoT in remote places.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Work With Us</h2>
    <p>
      We’re open to working with people building useful, honest systems — whether
      it's a field deployment, device integration, or something experimental.
